### Snapshots

* Snapshot releases may be deployed using `mvn clean deploy`
    * The version number in the pom.xml must end in -SNAPSHOT

### Prepare

* Make sure tests are green on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/aoju/bus).
* Run `mvn clean test` on every OS you have access to
* Choose an appropriate [version number](http://semver.org/) for the release
    * Proactively change version numbers in the download links on [README.md](README.md).
        * HTML-escape `&`, `<`, and `>` in any links in the site version
    * Move "Your contribution here." to a new empty "Next" section
    * Commit changes as a "prep for x.x release"

### Release

*

See [this page](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html#performing-a-release-deployment-with-the-maven-release-plugin)
for a summary of the below steps

* `mvn clean deploy`
    * Do a final snapshot release and fix any errors in the javadocs
    * If license headers are rewritten as part of this deployment, commit the changes
* `mvn release:clean`
    * Takes a few seconds
* `mvn release:prepare`
    * Takes a few minutes
    * This will ask for the version being released, removing -SNAPSHOT
    * This will suggest the next version, increment appropriately
* `mvn release:perform`
    * Takes a few minutes.
    * This pushes the release to the [Nexus](https://oss.sonatype.org/) staging repository
* Log on to [Nexus](https://oss.sonatype.org/)
  and [release the deployment from OSSRH to the Central Repository](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html)
  .

* Add a title and release notes [to the tag](https://github.com/aoju/bus/tags) on GitHub and publish the release to make
  it current.

* As development progresses, update version in [pom.xml](pom.xml) using -SNAPSHOT appended to the new version
  using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standards:
    * Increment major version (x.0) for API-breaking changes or additions
    * Increment minor version (x.1) for substantive additions, bugfixes and changes that are backwards compatible
    * Increment patch version (x.x.1) for minor bugfixes or changes that are backwards compatible
