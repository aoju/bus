# This properties file is automatically loaded at startup of the GlobalConfig

# Some containers enable alternate locations for the Linux /proc filesystem
# to provide container-level output in preference to system-level output.
# The /proc filesystem location
bus.health.proc.path=/proc
# The WMI query timeout in milliseconds
# Default is -1, no timeout
bus.health.wmi.timeout=-1
# Whether to perform WMI queries for command lines in a batch for all running
# processes. Individual WMI queries for the command line take about 50ms while
# querying the entire process list takes about 200ms. If you regularly expect
# to query command lines for more than a few processes this should be enabled
# for better performance. If you only rarely query command lines, leaving this
# disabled will be faster and conserve some resources. Defaults to false.
bus.health.os.windows.commandline.batch=false
# Whether to update the OSProcess state on Windows to SUSPENDED if all its
# threads are suspended. This requires querying thread states and can impact
# performance (Process list queries can take much longer) but if desired is
# better done once than for each process. Users may still determine this value
# themselves by querying thread details, but this method is extremely slow if
# done for every process. Enabling this will provide a more efficient (but
# still slow) update if this information is of value. Defaults to false.
bus.health.os.windows.procstate.suspended=false
# Whether to use "Processor Utility" for System and per-processor CPU Load ticks
# (on Windows 8 and higher) to match CPU usage with the Windows Task Manager.
#
# Windows Task Manager displays a measure of Processor Utility, which is an
# amount of work completed by the processor compared to the processor running
# full time at nominal frequency. Because of features which change CPU frequency
# such as Intel Speed Step, Intel Turbo Boost, AMD Precision Boost, and others,
# it is possible for this value to exceed 100% (although Task Manager caps it
# at 100%).
#
# By default, health uses "Processor Time" which measures active and idle times
# for each processor. CPU load is active time divided by total time. This matches
# the interpretation of Unix-based systems, the Task Manager for Windows 7 and
# earlier, The Task Manager "Details" tab for Process CPU usage (and health's
# per-process CPU usage), and Windows Sysinternals Process Explorer.
#
# Setting this value to true will allow health's CPU Load values to match the
# Windows Task manager output (except that health's numbers will not be capped
# at 100%) and will measure "work completed" rather than "processor time not idle".
# In the case load exceeds 100%, it is possible for "idle" ticks to decrease,
# i.e., the change between ticks would result in "negative idle time".
#
# Note that the base counter required for this calculation rolls over approximately
# every two hours. If your application remains idle for over an hour after
# instantiating the CentralProcessor object before polling for CPU usage, internal
# calculations may fail.  Instantiating a new SystemInfo object before collecting
# ticks will mitigate these problems.
bus.health.os.windows.cpu.utility=false
# Whether to attempt to fetch Windows performance counter data for processes
# and threads from HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA in the registry. Windows docs say
# to use the PDH API in preference to this, but the multiple native calls
# with JNA result in slower performance than a one-time grab of the data
# from the registry. Unfortunately, registry calls are more subject to
# problems with registry corruption, counter deletion when changing language
# settings, and other factors. Although the code will recover from failure
# to read these counters from the registry, it may be preferable to disable
# this attempt if failure is known/expected. Setting this property to false
# will skip the registry check and use the API-recommended (but slower)
# performance counter API (or WMI as a backup).
bus.health.os.windows.hkeyperfdata=true
# Whether to start a daemon thread to provide Load Averages for Windows.
# Load Average is a metric on Linux, macOS, and Unix operating systems that
# provides the average number of processes running or waiting for CPU (on
# Linux, the metric includes processes waiting for other resources such as
# disks.) While Windows does not provide this metric, the Processor Queue
# Length performance counter added to the average recent processor usage
# provides a similar metric.
#
# If this property is set true, a daemon thread will be started which will
# calculate an equivalent metric to Unix load average.
bus.health.os.windows.loadaverage=false
# Whether a class of performance counters is disabled. It is possible to
# disable performance counters by changing registry values, which can improve
# overall OS performance (such as for gaming) if the counters aren't desired.
#
# When attempting to query counters, OSHI provides a (one time) log warning
# for the performance counter itself and a (each time) COM exception if the
# WMI table backing up the counter fails. The associated log messages can be
# confusing to users or developers of applications which depend on OSHI.
#
# If counters are either intentionally disabled, or the application depending
# on OSHI does not require any of the relevant performance counters, setting
# these values to true will skip querying these counters and return 0 values
# for the associated metrics. No log messages will be generated.
#
# If these values are not set at all, OSHI will query the registry to determine
# whether they are disabled and warn users if this is the case (this is the default).
# The associated Windows registry keys are at:
# HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfOS\Performance\Disable Performance Counters
# HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfProc\Performance\Disable Performance Counters
# HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfDisk\Performance\Disable Performance Counters
# where a value of 0 is not disabled and any other value disables counters.
#
# PerfOS counters used for CPU ticks, swap file usage, page swaps, context switches, interrupts
bus.os.windows.perfos.disabled=
#
# PerfProc counters used for process and thread priority, time, IO, memory usage
# (also see config for oshi.os.windows.hkeyperfdata)
bus.os.windows.perfproc.disabled=
#
# PerfDisk counters used for HWDiskStore reads/writes/queue length/xfer time
bus.os.windows.perfdisk.disabled=
# On Linux, most process metrics are read from the proc pseudo-filesystem.
# When operating without elevated permissions, this results in frequent error
# messages for failures to read the process environment files. Set this to true
# to receive these warnings.
bus.os.linux.procfs.logwarning=false
# On macOS, Linux, and Unix systems, the default getSessions() method on the
# OperatingSystem interface uses native code (see {@code man getutxent}) that
# is not thread safe. health's use of this code is synchronized and may be used
# in a multi-threaded environment without introducing any additional conflicts.
# Users should note, however, that other operating system code may access the
# same native code.
#
# The Who#queryWho() method produces similar output parsing
# the output of the Posix-standard "who" command, and may internally employ
# reentrant code on some platforms. Setting this configuration to true will
# use the command-line variant.  Defaults to false.
bus.health.os.unix.whoCommand=false
# Solaris 11.4 deprecated the previous kstat API and introduced kstat2, with
# additional features. OSHI uses the new API if it is available. However,
# there may be a file descriptor leak when parallel GC is in use. Setting
# this configuration to false will always use the original kstat API even if
# Kstat2 is available.
bus.health.os.solaris.allowKstat2=true
# The name of the System event log containing bootup event IDs 12 and 6005.
#
# This is used for a one-time calculation of system boot time that should be
# consistent across process runs regardless of sleep/hibernate cycles, at
# the small cost of ~250ms latency reading upon WindowsOperatingSystem
# initialization.
#
# If the specified log is the empty string, or doesn't contain a bootup event,
# boot time will be calculated by subtracting up time from current time. This
# may vary by up to a millisecond between program executions and does not
# properly account for sleep/hibernate cycles, but when using the empty string
# is fast and may be preferred if only approximate boot time is desired.
#
# If a non-empty invalid log name is specified, the name "Application" will
# be used. The default is System
bus.health.os.windows.eventlog=System
# Memoizer default expiration in milliseconds (return values will be cached this long)
# Must be positive (negative value will never refresh)
